										<p>The Science Gurus Computer Science Internship was developed in 2020 as a way to introduce younger students to technological fields. 
										It was created by Vivek Vijaykumar and Shreya Kochar, who are both alumni of Science Guruâ€™s Science Lab program. 
										The duration of the program is 4 weeks total. 
										We will have 3 classes a week, one of which will be a guest lecture, and the other two will be 1.5 hour teaching sessions. 
										This program entails exposing students to the most widely used language, Python, and explaining its nuances.</p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Program Objective</b>
												<p>The Computer Science Summer Internship is designed to introduce basic computer science ideas and logical thinking to students 
												and give them an exposure to the field of computer science .</p>
											</li>
											<li><b>Target Audience</b>
												<p>7th to 9th grade students</p>
											</li>
											<li><b>Expectations</b>
												<p>Interns are expected to be on time to every session and maintain good attendance, unless they have notified an instructor in advance. 
												Interns are also expected to complete homework assignments assigned in the previous class before coming to the next lesson. 
												Finally, they are expected to complete the final project without errors and write an analysis report in research paper formatting. 
												The time commitment for this program is about 1-1.5 hours of outside homework after each class, so roughly 7-8 hours a week.</p>
