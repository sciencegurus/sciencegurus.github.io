											<li><b>What is the Computer Science Summer Internship Program?</b><br/>
												<p>The Computer Science Summer Internship is designed to motivate rising 8th-10th grade students in fields of technology. 
												In a drastically changing world, these skills are necessary. Our program aims to introduce computer science ideas and 
												logical thinking in young students so that they have the skills to take higher level computer science classes in high 
												school and college. Furthermore, we aim to bring several different speakers who actively use computer science in their 
												fields in order to expose students to the several opportunities that revolve around technology.</p>
											</li>
											<li><b>What is the format of the program?</b><br/>
												<p>The program will be hosted online through zoom for the summer of 2020 due to COVID-19. The program will consist of 
												12 classes with 3 classes/week (Mon, Wed, Fri) and a guest speaker presentation once a week. Classes will be 1.5 hours 
												long and will include a presentation of the concepts by the instructors followed by workout out sample problems. 
												Students are expected to complete the homework assigned on time by the next meeting. By the end of the program, 
												students will complete a final project and present it to their classmates, instructors, Science Gurus faculty, and parents.
												</p>
											</li
											<li><b>Who are the instructors?</b><br/>
												<p>Shreya Kochar and Vivek Vijaykumar, the founding members of the program, will be the main instructors. Shreya is a 
												sophomore at Wellesley College, while Vivek is a freshman at Georgia Institute of Technology. They are both studying 
												computer science. Other instructors maybe be added at a later date.</p>
											</li>
